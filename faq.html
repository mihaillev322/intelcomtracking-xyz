<h1>Frequently Asked Questions About Intelcom Tracking</h1>

<p>Customers shipping and receiving packages through Intelcom Courrier Canada often have questions about tracking their deliveries, understanding status updates, and resolving delivery issues. This comprehensive FAQ addresses the most common concerns based on thousands of customer inquiries and our experience monitoring courier services across North America.</p>

<p>Intelcom has grown substantially since 2015, when Amazon began using them as a primary delivery partner in Canada. This growth brought increased package volumes and expanded service areas, but also generated questions from customers unfamiliar with the carrier. Whether you're tracking your first Intelcom package or you're a frequent recipient trying to resolve a specific issue, these answers provide actionable information to help you monitor and manage your deliveries effectively.</p>

<div class="card">
<details>
<summary>How do I track my Intelcom package?</summary>
<p>Enter your tracking number on the Intelcom official website in the tracking field located on their homepage. Your tracking number is a 12-16 digit code found in your shipping confirmation email or provided by the sender. The system displays real-time updates including current location, transit history, and estimated delivery date. For enhanced features like push notifications and photo delivery confirmation, download the Intelcom mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The app lets you save multiple tracking numbers and receive alerts when your package status changes. Third-party tracking aggregators also work, but may show delays of up to one hour compared to Intelcom's direct system. If you don't have a tracking number, contact the sender or retailer who shipped your package, as they can provide it or track the shipment on your behalf through their merchant portal.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What does Intelcom delivered mean?</summary>
<p>The 'Delivered' status confirms that an Intelcom driver successfully completed delivery to your specified address. This status includes a timestamp showing the exact date and time of delivery, typically accurate within one minute. In most cases, you'll also see a photo showing where the driver placed your package, whether at your front door, in a mailroom, with a building concierge, or at another secure location. If someone signed for the package, the tracking information may display a signature confirmation instead of or in addition to the photo. Delivery confirmation usually appears in the tracking system within 2-5 minutes of the driver scanning the package as delivered. Check the photo or location notes to determine exactly where your package was left. If the tracking shows 'Delivered' but you cannot locate your package, first check with household members, neighbors, or building management, then contact Intelcom customer service within 24 hours to file a delivery inquiry.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is my Intelcom tracking not updating?</summary>
<p>Tracking updates may pause for several legitimate reasons during the shipping process. Packages moving between regional facilities during overnight hours often show no updates for 8-12 hours until they reach the next scanning checkpoint. Weather delays, particularly during Canadian winters, can interrupt normal scanning procedures as drivers prioritize safety and package protection over administrative tasks. Technical issues with handheld scanners or network connectivity at remote facilities occasionally cause update gaps. However, if your tracking hasn't updated for more than 48 hours, this warrants investigation. Contact Intelcom customer service with your tracking number so they can manually locate your package in their system. Sometimes packages are physically progressing through the network but missing scans at intermediate points. The package may still arrive on schedule even with tracking gaps. For high-value shipments showing no updates beyond the initial 'Package Received' status after 72 hours, request an escalated trace investigation to physically locate the item within Intelcom's facility network.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I change my Intelcom delivery address after shipping?</summary>
<p>Address changes are possible but depend heavily on your package's current status in the delivery network. If your package shows 'Package Received' or 'In Transit' status and hasn't yet reached the local delivery facility, Intelcom can often reroute it to a new address within the same general service area. Contact customer service immediately with your tracking number and both the original and new delivery addresses. Once the package reaches 'At Local Facility' or 'Out for Delivery' status, address changes become significantly more difficult or impossible, as the package has already been sorted and loaded onto a delivery vehicle. Some retailers who ship via Intelcom offer delivery management options through their own websites or apps, allowing you to redirect packages before they reach the carrier. The success rate for address changes drops from approximately 80% during early transit stages to less than 10% once out for delivery. Alternative options include arranging to pick up the package at an Intelcom facility or having it held for pickup at a partner location, though availability varies by region.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does Intelcom take to deliver packages?</summary>
<p>Standard Intelcom delivery timeframes range from same-day to 2 business days depending on the service level the shipper selected and the distance between origin and destination. For packages shipped within the same metropolitan area (Toronto to Toronto, Montreal to Montreal), same-day or next-day delivery is typical, with most packages arriving within 24 hours of entering the Intelcom network. Shipments between major cities like Toronto to Montreal usually take 1-2 business days. Longer routes to smaller communities or remote areas may extend to 3-4 business days, though Intelcom's coverage in rural regions is more limited than Canada Post. According to their service standards, 92% of packages in major urban centers arrive within the promised delivery window. Peak shopping seasons like Black Friday through Christmas can add 1-2 days to normal delivery times due to volume surges. The tracking system provides an estimated delivery date that updates based on the package's actual progress, giving you the most accurate prediction. Weekend deliveries are available in most service areas, which can actually speed up delivery compared to carriers that only operate Monday through Friday.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do if my Intelcom package shows delivered but I didn't receive it?</summary>
<p>Start by thoroughly checking your entire property including side doors, back porches, garages, and any covered areas where a driver might have placed the package for weather protection. Review the delivery photo in your tracking details, which shows exactly where the driver left the package and can help you identify the specific location. Ask household members, neighbors in adjacent units, or building staff if they accepted the package on your behalf. In multi-unit buildings, packages are sometimes delivered to the wrong unit number, so checking with immediate neighbors often resolves the issue. If you still cannot locate the package after these steps, contact Intelcom customer service within 24 hours to file a delivery discrepancy report. They will investigate with the driver who made the delivery and review GPS coordinates confirming the delivery location. Also contact the retailer or shipper, as they may need to file an insurance claim or send a replacement. According to <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/package-theft/how-to-prevent-package-theft-a1154115364/">Consumer Reports data on package theft</a>, approximately 1.7% of delivered packages are stolen from doorsteps, so if theft is suspected, consider filing a police report, particularly for high-value items. Many credit cards offer purchase protection that covers stolen deliveries.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Intelcom require a signature for delivery?</summary>
<p>Signature requirements depend entirely on the shipping options selected by the sender, not on Intelcom's standard procedures. Most e-commerce packages shipped via Intelcom use 'no signature required' service, allowing drivers to leave packages at the door without recipient interaction. This contactless delivery method became even more prevalent after 2020 and remains the default for the majority of shipments. However, senders can request signature confirmation for high-value items, age-restricted products, or shipments requiring proof of receipt. When signature is required, the tracking system indicates this status, and drivers will attempt to obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address. If no one is available, the driver leaves a delivery notice card with instructions for arranging redelivery or pickup. Business addresses more commonly require signatures compared to residential deliveries. Some retailers offer delivery preferences during checkout where you can request signature confirmation even if not required, though this may incur additional fees. During delivery attempts for signature-required packages, drivers typically wait 60-90 seconds after knocking or ringing the doorbell before marking the delivery as attempted.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I track Intelcom packages without a tracking number?</summary>
<p>Tracking without a tracking number is extremely difficult and generally not possible through standard Intelcom systems. The tracking number serves as the unique identifier linking you to your specific package among millions in their network. However, you have several alternative approaches if you don't have the tracking number readily available. Check your email inbox and spam folder for shipping confirmation messages from the retailer, which almost always include tracking information. Log into your account on the retailer's website where you placed the order, as most e-commerce sites display tracking numbers in order history sections. Contact the seller's customer service department with your order number, and they can provide the Intelcom tracking number or track the package on your behalf through their merchant portal. If you know the approximate shipping date and delivery address, Intelcom customer service may be able to locate your package using these details, though this process takes significantly longer and isn't guaranteed. For future shipments, save tracking numbers immediately when you receive them, or use the Intelcom app to store all your tracking information in one place for easy reference.</p>
